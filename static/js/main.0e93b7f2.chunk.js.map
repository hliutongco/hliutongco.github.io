After several years working in digital marketing in Chicago, she felt it was time for some momentous change in her life.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Unfortunately, she was clueless as to which career she should switch to. She dabbled in freelance writing for a bit but felt that her chances of earning a living wage were slim.\n      There was International Affairs, which she majored in during college, but she never honestly knew what to do with that degree.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      It was a year of feeling adrift. She received her first solid clue at debugging this error in the autumn, when her father encouraged her to try coding.\n      She had never envisioned herself as a coder, but past experiences had taught her that the best things in life were often unplanned.

She attended Flatiron, a bootcamp in Manhattan, and after graduating, she was fortunate enough to be chosen as a technical coach for the Brooklyn campus.</p>\n      <p>As a student, she had often heard of imposter syndrome—the feeling that one has not truly earned their position or title. But at the time, she felt that it was perfectly natural to feel like a novice. Why guilt yourself over it?</p>\n      <p>However, as a technical coach, she began to feel it: a creeping insecurity, one that seemed to grow with each of her students' confounding queries or unresolved errors. When panicked, she reminded herself that it was impossible to know everything.

She approached this new venture with some trepidation. After all, she had no computer science background nor any experience with technical interviews.</p>\n      <p>She imagined there would be times when she would feel completely lost, perhaps even foolish. She knew she wouldn't have answers to all the questions thrown her way.</p>\n      <p>Even so, it wouldn't be the first time she received this error.
